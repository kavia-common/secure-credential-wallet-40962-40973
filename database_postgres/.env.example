# Database Container Environment Variables

# Path to SQLite database file used in development. The backend should point DB_URL to this sqlite file path.
# Note: The file will be created if it doesn't exist. Relative to the backend_api working directory this is ./app.db
SQLITE_DB=./app.db

# Optional: Full DB URL for services that read a single variable instead of SQLITE_DB.
# For development we stick to SQLite file. If switching to Postgres, replace with postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@host:port/dbname
DB_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
